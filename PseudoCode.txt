createObject(String JsonStringWhatUserIsPassing, int ttl)
	- This method must create a JSONObject with the following keys we will call it as MASTER_OBJECT
		- key ( Random UUID )
		- actualJsonObject - it itself is a JSONObject - we will call this ACT_OBJ for our discussion
		- creationTimeStamp
		- ttl (0 if not provided)
	- Flow of this method,
		- check if the message size is less == 16KB
		- check if the adding this message will make the folder greater than 1 GB
			- Failure 
				- Throw ExceededAllowedBlahBlah Exception and provide a message
			- Success
				- Create a JSONObject to store the incoming string
					- Failure to create JSONObject
						- Throw BadInput Exception and give a meaning message with the Exception
					- Successful creation 
						- ACT_OBJ is inserted into the MASTER_OBJECT
				- Now we have MASTER_OBJECT will all 4 key and we insert 
					- Convert this MASTER_OBJECT into a String and write into the file
						- On success write
							- Write the id and file name into a INDEX file


getObject(String key) 
	- Check if the index file has the key
		- No
			- throw NotFound Exception
		- YES
			- Get the file name
			- Read the file contents
			- Locate the record
			- Retrieve
				- ACT_OBJ
				- ttl
				- create timeStamp fields
			- Check if ttl is greater than 0 and add it to the Create Time Stamp and then compare it with Current time Stamp
				- Example 
					- if TTL is 3600 ( 1 hr )
					- Create Time Stamo is 4:30 PM
					- When the request comes in @ 5:15 PM to read this object
						- Add 1 hr to 4:30 = 5:30 PM
						- Time is now 5:15 PM so the object is accessible for next 15 more minutes hence can be shown
						- But id the req comes in @ 7:30 PM , throw NOT FOUND Exception
			- Return ACT_OBJ from this method


deleteObject(String key)
	- Check if the index file has the key
		- No
			- throw NotFound Exception
		- YES
			- Get the file name
			- Read the file contents
			- Locate the record
			- Retrieve
				- ACT_OBJ
				- ttl
				- create timeStamp fields
			- Check if ttl is greater than 0 and add it to the Create Time Stamp and then compare it with Current time Stamp
				- Example 
					- if TTL is 3600 ( 1 hr )
